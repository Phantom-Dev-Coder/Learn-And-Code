          <h2>Why did I create this site?</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of building this place was nothing more than to be able to create a prototype while practicing and learning and to be able to display a sample of my work.Of course, since I couldn't find a site like this myself, especially when I was just starting out, I hope this can give you a general perspective and help you figure out how and where to start in this field.

          <h2>The efficiency of this site.</h2>
          <p>
            Here, in addition to the fact that I built the whole thing myself and designed everything myself, and it can be said that it is a complete work sample and is gradually becoming more complete, there are also a series of small projects that you can have fun with and also build yourself. Look at them as a kind of small work sample.

                  An interesting project that can be very interesting.
                  Of course, to create it, you need skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
